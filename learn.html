          <h1>What is Gentrification?</h1>
          <p>
            Gentrification is caused when an areaâ€™s real estate value is very
            low but is located near or has new transport lines to middle class
            amenities.
          </p>

          <p>
            This provides an opportunity for developers to make high profits on
            rebuilding or renovating low-income houses, turning them into middle
            class housing and eventually pricing out the established low-income
            residents.

          <h1>Is it Revitalization?</h1>
          <p>
            Detractors say that what is known as gentrification is
            actually revitalization and is a positive impact on communities.
            They cite the rise in property values and boost in public school
            funding as evidence. But if long-term residents are not around to
            reap these benefits the positive impact goes towards outsiders.

              Graduate Hospital, historically a working-class African American,
              has close access to Broad and South Streets.

              Developers started building new
              and renovated homes this sent surrounding home prices soaring.
              Home values tripled from 2000-2014 and brought in an influx
              of wealthier individuals that were 90% percent white.
            </p> 
            <p>
              This led to a
              decrease in the Afican American population of GH from 90% African
              American to 38% African American.
